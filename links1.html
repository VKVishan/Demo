			Part 1 describes the basic introductory concepts necessary for a good understanding of database models, systems, and languages. Chapters 1 and 2 introduce databases, typical users, and DBMS concepts, terminology, and architecture.

			Part 2 describes the relational data model, the SQL standard, and the formal relational languages. Chapter 3 describes the basic relational model, its integrity constraints, and update operations. Chapter 4 describes some of the basic parts of the SQL standard for relational databases, including data definition, data modification operations, and simple SQL queries. Chapter 5 presents more complex SQL queries,
			as well as the SQL concepts of triggers, assertions, views, and schema modification. Chapter 6 describes the operations of the relational algebra and introduces the relational calculus.

			Part 3 covers several topics related to conceptual database modeling and database design. In Chapter 7, the concepts of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model and ER diagrams are presented and used to illustrate conceptual database design. Chapter 8 focuses on data abstraction and semantic data modeling concepts and shows how
			the ER model can be extended to incorporate these ideas, leading to the enhancedER (EER) data model and EER diagrams. The concepts presented in Chapter 8 include subclasses, specialization, generalization, and union types (categories). The notation for the class diagrams of UML is also introduced in Chapters 7 and 8.
			Chapter 9 discusses relational database design using ER- and EER-to-relational mapping. We end Part 3 with Chapter 10, which presents an overview of the different phases of the database design process in enterprises for medium-sized and large database applications.
